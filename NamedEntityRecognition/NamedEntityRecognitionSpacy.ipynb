       "'Conflicting reports attribute the incident to the Armed Commandos of Liberation and the Armed Revolutionary Independence Movement (MIRA).The police were unsure if this incident was an attempted robbery, with the perpetrators too frightened to take the targets money, or if it was an assassination.Huang and Cheng Tzu-tsai were arrested but jumped bail and fled the United States.It is believed that a Chicago businessman was angry at Barr for attempting to introduce reform legislation concerning mental health issues in the Illinois General Assembly.  It is suspected that the businessman contacted Silas Jayne to hire the hit men.The White mayoral candidate was Hugh Addonizio and the Black mayoral candidate was Kenneth Gibson.Allan Daly survived two weeks before finally succumbing to his wounds.  Frank Thurber belonged to the San Francisco Mailers Union.  Thurber offered Richard Wamsley and Larry Rutherford $300 to \"rough up\" Daly.  Thurber provided them with a weapon and drove the to Daly\\'s home.  Printers used by non-striking members of the San Rafael Independent journal were firebombed days later (197007080002).John Thomas was one of the accused perpetrators of 197001250001.  Seth Stanley was acquitted based on a successful argument of self defense, but it is important to note that John Thomas was shot as he was sitting in his truck.  A Black boycott of White-owned businesses in West Point was initiated as a result of this incident.Christopher Brian Cowsar was a former marine.  He was captured by two men who rushed to save Sergeant Mobley after they heard him screaming.The incident took place two days after a scuffle between the Jewish Defense League and the National Socialist White People\\'s party in front of the Nazi party\\'s local headquarters.  Joe Tommasi was a lieutenant of the National Socialist White People\\'s party and Irving Rubin was the head of the Jewish Defense League\\'s Los Angeles chapter.  Rubin would eventually be released due to lack of evidence.This event was one of a series of related attacks during this time (see events 197309040001, 197310180002).  On September 4, 1973, a Black Muslim leader, James Shabazz is murdered by members of New World of Islam, a rival faction of Black Muslims.  On October 18, 1973, two more Black Muslim dissidents are killed and beheaded by others in the New World sect in the midst of feuding Black Muslim factions.  This case in particular may not be terrorism because the Bankston brothers were allegedly murdered for disobeying orders so this is a case of inner-party conflict.  Also, two members of the New World, Albert Chavies and Lamont Calloway, were later convicted for the murder of the Bankston brothers. Chavies and Calloway were also convicted and sentenced for the Shabazz murder.'"
